### About the project
This project was my first attempt using CSS Grid. I had some difficulty with the padding. Instead of placing padding around the grid as a whole, I put padding in each individual content. I had some thinking to do when it came to a mobile view, I know there are different ways I could have designed it for mobile. However, I'm satisfied with the end results :)
